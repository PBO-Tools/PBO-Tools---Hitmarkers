## About The Project

PBO Tools Hitmarkers is a DayZ game mod designed to introduce hitmarkers into custom servers. With this mod, server owners gain the flexibility to personalize the hitmarkers, deciding whether they apply to various entities like animals, zombies, players, and Expansion helicopters. Moreover, players themselves can easily toggle hitmarkers on or off in their own game using a keybind. Presently, the mod sets hitmarkers for critical hits on zombies and animals, such as brain or headshots, as the default setting. However, upcoming updates will allow players to configure this aspect to suit their preferences.
